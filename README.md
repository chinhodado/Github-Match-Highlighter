This is an userscript that will highlight all matches of the clicked on word in the Github code viewer.

Grab it [here](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/chinhodado/Github_Matches_Highlighter). You will need to install Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey first.

It is also available as a Chrome extension [here](https://github.com/chinhodado/Github-Matches-Highlighter/releases).
